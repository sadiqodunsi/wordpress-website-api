# wordpress-website-api
The plugin exposes the content/functionalities of a WordPress wesbite with WP REST API.

This custom plugin is built for a specific website that uses JWT Auth plugin (for authentication) and WooCommerce among others.

The aim of the plugin is to show how WordPress can be used as headless CMS
